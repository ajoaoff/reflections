How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I could see only the differences between a working version and the bugged version, showing
easily where te error was.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer
in the long term?
I can more easily find where an error was made, even if the error is discovered just a long time
after.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do 
in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Manual commit lets you choose when it's good time to create a version, but you may be unable to
work at another location if you forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Google Docs is made for documents, and generally two documents are not related. Git is meant for
coding, and usually you have a lot of related files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
If the changes break something, one could always roll back.
