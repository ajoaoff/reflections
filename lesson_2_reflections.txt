What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates the metadata, marking that directory as a repository. It is
necessary for git to take control of what is changed.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area have files that are part of the repository but have been
changed since last commit. Not all files in the working directory are necessarily
part of the staging area.
