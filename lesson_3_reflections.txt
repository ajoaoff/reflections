When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to share my work with others, or when I need to work from differente locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?
I may want to commit every logic change, but share them only when everything is functioning.
I also may to want to get other people's changes before my own are ready.
