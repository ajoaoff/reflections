When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to share my work with others, or when I need to work from differente locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?
I may want to commit every logic change, but share them only when everything is functioning.
I also may to want to get other people's changes before my own are ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead
of another?
Clone is a copy of one repository. Fork is a special case of clone, working only on GitHub.
Branch is line of development. Fork can be used to make changes in a repository from
another person. Clone is used, for example, to copy a repository from GitHub to your local
machine. Branch is used when you want to try a new feature in your own repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can work with the most recent changes other people have made even if you get offline.
